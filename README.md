An NSS group project with contributions from Brendon Pierson, Jesse Turner, Mary Kergosien, and Deric Bunch.  The objective of this game is to collect all of the tootsie rolls as fast as you can while avoiding the spiders.  The game board is modeled after the Nashville Software School, and the player is modeled after the instructor Steve.  The game has automatic facebook Oauth so at the end of game your time is sent to the database.  The top ten times are populated on the page from the database.
